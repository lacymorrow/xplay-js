XPlay.js
========

The drop–and–go html5 media player
xPlay.js is a helpful tool in playing multiple media files on a website. Scan an entire directory and generate a playlist, complete with album art, from your audio and video. Playlist is completely customizable via CSS and controlled via JS.

Video support is now available. Who would have guessed? It works on iDevices too!

* A media directory is scanned recursively using a PHP script and file associations are made to connect video sources, and artwork for audio tracks.
* An XSPF playlist file is generated and saved (for caching purposes). Files can be named using the directory structure or using built–in ID3 tag information.
* A jQuery script is then generated which outputs playlist and track information elements to the page. Customize the elements as you please, all of the track handling is taken care of!
The open–source media player Media–Element.js is included by default.

This is a work in progress.
